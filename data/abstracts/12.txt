We present a quantitative study of digital signage audience measurement using computer vision. We developed a camera enhanced digital signage display that acquires audience measurement metrices with computer vision algorithms. Temporal metrices of person's dwell time, display in-view time, and attention time are extracted. The system also determines demographic metrices of gender and age group. The digital signage display was deployed in a real world environment of a clothing boutique, where demographic and viewership data of 1294 persons ensemble was recorded, manually verified and analysed. Analysis shows that 35% of ensemble specifically looked-at the display, having the average attention time of 0.7s. Interestingly, the attention time was substantially higher for men (1.2s) as for women (0.4s). Age group comparison reveals that youth (1-14 years) are the most responsive to the digital signage. Finally, the analysis shows that the average attention time is significantly higher when displaying the dynamic content (0.9s) as compared to the static content (0.6s).
