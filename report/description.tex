\todo{Some simple description of persistence diagrams}

The main idea behind this project was to determine whether or not persistence
diagrams built on top of documents from different domains differ significantly
enough between the domains that they alone could be used to classify the texts.
Because of ease of computation we mainly restricted ourselves to generators up
to and including with second dimension. This restriction comes with a benefit
of being somewhat intuitively explainable: generators of dimension 0 count
