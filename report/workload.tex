\section{Workload} 
\label{sec:workload}

The work on this project was even more collaboratory then was the case in the first project, meaning sometimes all three of us would work and contribute on the same issue. It is therefore hard to say who did what and give credit where credit is due. Nonetheless here is the distribution of the workload.

\begin{itemize}
  \item A
  \item P
  \item R collected the sports dataset, implemented the tf-idf method for extracting additional features, designed the drawing of barcode plots and persistence diagrams, performed benchmark clustering methods on the features matrix, chose the graphs for the presentation.
\end{itemize}

Writting the report was again a joined efford.
