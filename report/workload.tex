\section{Workload}
\label{sec:workload}

The work on this project was even more collaborative then was the case in the
first project, meaning sometimes all three of us would work and contribute on
the same issue. It is therefore hard to say who did what and give credit where
credit is due. Nonetheless here is the distribution of the workload.

\begin{itemize}
  \item A collected movie reviews dataset, implemented preprocessor that loaded
    text documents, combined them with pre-preprocessor, feature selection and
    tf-idf and constructed X and y matrices, implemented interfaces to Čech
    complex and Vietoris-Rips complex from Dionysus, wrote code that took
    outputs from all three complex building methods and constructed persistence
    diagrams from them, and wrote the glue that ran all the steps required for
    our analysis of the data;
  \item P collected the abstracts dataset, implemented the texts preprocessors which
    removed stopped words and applied stemming and lemmatization, implemented various
    methods for extracting text features, wrote code for hierarchical clustering on top
    of the bottleneck distances of persistence diagrams, performed clustering tests on
    the main dataset and implemented clustering on the toy dataset
  \item R collected the sports dataset, implemented the tf-idf method for
    extracting additional features, designed the drawing of barcode plots and
    persistence diagrams, performed benchmark clustering methods on the
    features matrix, chose the graphs for the presentation.
\end{itemize}

Writing the report was again a joined effort.
